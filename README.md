Physical buzzer system for quiz/history/science bowl supporting up to 8 teams of 6, a player buzzed readout, adjustable lockout, and self contained moderator control

The Pi zero W is optional, but provides programming an hdmi output switchable between moderator and audience views with a possible webserver in the future
Theoretically more teams could be added, but the design is currently constrained to 6 players per team.
